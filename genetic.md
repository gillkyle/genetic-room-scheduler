# 1 - Init

Represent the solution
Create a population (a whole bunch of solutions with different assignemnts)
Fitness function (determine how well this represents the best solution)

#2 - Evaluate

Get the overall fitness of the solution (avg the fitnesses)

# 3 - Combine

Take a percentage of the solutions to reuse for genetic combination/mating

# 4 - Mutations

Flipping things, switching things randomly
Simply combining will keep you in a local max or local min, randomness can help you jump those gaps

Create a Generation that holds multiple solutions
